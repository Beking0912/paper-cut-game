# Paper-cutting Game

# Game Design
Embarking on the fascinating journey of game design, my inspiration drew from the ancient Chinese art of paper cutting, an enchanting craft steeped in intricate designs. Rooted in rural communities, paper cutting not only symbolizes marital bliss, prosperity, and harmony but also serves as a storytelling medium, reflecting historical events and values.

In my application, I aim to showcase the beauty of the symmetrical artistry of paper cutting, offering users an immersive experience. The core of the game revolves around guiding players through the process of symmetrical paper cutting, starting with a user-friendly tutorial. The game then prompts users to predict the symmetrical patterns that unfold as they fold and cut the paper, presenting three options for them to choose the correct outcome.

Technologically, I utilized Swift for app development, incorporating captivating animations on the splash screen and tutorial pages. I designed a set of materials by Figma, and used a low-saturation color palette in app to evoke a warm ambiance.

By creating this app, my aspiration is for users to appreciate the artistic beauty of traditional Chinese paper cutting, fostering a connection with the cultural heritage. Moreover, I hope to inspire players to try their hand at real-life paper cutting, blending virtual entertainment with a tangible and culturally rich experience.
